    <h2><u>Generators</u></h2>
    <h2>Generators in ES6</h2>
    <h2>Generators can help you to resume and pause the code
    <h2>The function * is used to define a keyword in generator function
    <h2>Yield is an operator which passes the generator
    <h2>Yield also help us to receive input & send output</h2>
    <h2>next() method will start the execution till the yield operator.</h2>
    <h2>next() method returns an object which has two keys.</h2>
    <h2>next() method has two keys,value and boolean(next status)</h2>
    <h2>Instead of next() we use the loop to iterate the generator</h2>
    <h2>As it is iteratable we can use spread operator(...) with it.It will create an array with returned values.</h2>
    <h2>[Symbol.iterator] as a whole an it is iterable</h2>
    <h2>Generators functions are rarely used in javascript code,but for asynchronous processes,iterators and generators can work as well</h2>
